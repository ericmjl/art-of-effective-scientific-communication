# about myself

- Undergrad: Univ. British Columbia, Vancouver, Integrated Sciences
- Doctoral: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Biological Engineering
- Self-taught Pythonista. Python is really fun, and lets you do a ton of things!

# main ideas

1. Communicate your idea as simply as possible, but no simpler than necessary.
1. Find a safe space and time to develop your thoughts.
1. Strategically select colleagues to help give you feedback.
1. Multiple rounds of rewriting is inevitable.

# simplicity

## temptation

- You've done a ton of work.
- You want to include everything.
- *这样才能对得起自己的付出，对吧？*

## reality

- Your audience won't necessarily have enough **background**.
- Your reviewers may not have enough **time**.
- Nobody but you knows best the **details** of what you've done.

## the artful principle

How do I phrase my idea, such that:

- it and nothing more is sufficient for my audience to know what I'm saying, and that
- it and nothing less is necessary for my audience to know what I'm saying?

*Who is my audience, and how do I know what they know?*

## before

![All four figures from my first set of submissions to Nature, Science and eLife.](./figures/four-figures.png){#figures .class}

## after

![The final figure that told the story in its entirety, in the submission to PNAS](./figures/fig1-pnas.png){#fig1 .class}

## word diet

- before: 2794 words in main text.
- after: 1847 words in main text.

## what happened?

# space & time

The details matter: take charge, experiment, and design your environment to fit your needs.

## spaces

I found spaces where I could write and think in isolation.

Yet, other people doing work in those same spaces.

## time

My advisor let me set the tempo, and I repaid the trust with regular updates.

# feedback

## advisor

**"Does it make sense to my advisor?"**

- Advisor is responsible for packaging your story into research group's overall scientific direction.

## communications lab

**"Does it make sense to a relative outsider?"**

- A "general biologist" should understand the general implications of my research.

## your mom

*Don't bother.*

# rounds and rounds of editing

## let it go

First drafts are always going to be unsatisfactory. Let it go.

## each round gets better

Each rewrite clarifies the scientific idea further.

## beware the details
