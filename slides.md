# about myself

- Undergrad: Univ. British Columbia, Vancouver, Integrated Sciences
- Doctoral: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Biological Engineering
- Self-taught Pythonista. Python is really fun, and lets you do a ton of things!

# main ideas

1. Your idea should be as simple as possible, but no simpler than necessary.
1. You will need a safe space and time to develop your thoughts.
1. You will want to strategically select colleagues to help give you feedback

# simplicity

## temptation

- You've done a ton of work.
- You want to include everything.
- *这样才能对得起自己的付出，对吧？*

## reality

- Background: audience won't necessarily have this.
- Time: reviewers (especially) will be busy.
- Details: nobody but you knows best what you've done.

## the artful principle

How do I phrase my idea, such that:

- it and nothing more is sufficient for my audience to know what I'm saying, and that
- it and nothing less is necessary for my audience to know what I'm saying?

## word diet (文字减肥计划)

- before: 2794 words in main text.
- after: 1847 words in main text.

## what happened?

# space & time

## spaces

I found spaces where I could write all day long.

## time

Because I had gained my advisor's trust, I earned the right to not be pressured by him.

It's a two-way trust!

## fresh eyes

I tackled one idea per day, and never rewrote the same sections on consecutive days.
